#SCENE 1 — THE MYTHQUAKE CLASH (Behind-the-Scenes Expansion)
Scene ID: EP01_SC01
Runtime Allotment: 00:00–01:20 (including title card)
Key Visual (Image #1): Refer to image

📝 1. Narrative Purpose
 * Inciting Incident: This scene serves as the absolute beginning of the Mythos X: Godshift narrative. It's the "big bang" that kicks off all subsequent events.
   
 * Establishment of Core Conflict: Instantly introduces the fundamental cosmic struggle between Creation (Aether Sovereign) and Destruction (Oblivion Archon). This isn't just a battle; it's a clash of primal forces.
   
 * Scale and Stakes: Visually establishes the immense power of the divine entities and the immediate, planet-altering consequences of their conflict for Earth. This sets the cosmic stakes for the entire series.
   
 * Tone Setting: Immediately communicates the epic, high-stakes sci-fantasy tone. this is bang bang bang , The citizens even there future avatars are looking to the sky like what the he'll is that all over the world 

   
🎨 2. Visual Directives & Notes for Animators/Artists
 * Divine Contrast:
   
   * Aether Sovereign: Emphasize luminous, structured energy. His form, while powerful, should convey a sense of order and defined purpose. Think celestial light, clean lines, almost crystalline power. His attacks are precise, forceful, but contained.     
   * Oblivion Archon: Emphasize raw, chaotic, consuming energy. His form is darker, spikier, conveying entropy and dissolution. His attacks are aggressive, spreading, and have a "tearing" quality.    
 * Impact Visualization: The moment their fists connect should not just be an explosion. It should be a reality-warping event.
   * Shockwave: Not a simple radial blast. Visualize it as ripples through dimensions, like throwing a stone into a pond where the "water" is spacetime. Show distortion, shimmering, and color shifts.
   * Hexagonal Patterns: The sky fracturing into hexagonal light patterns on Earth is crucial. This is a recurring motif for Mythflow distortion—a visual shorthand for when cosmic energies are directly impacting reality. It suggests a "breaking" of a cosmic grid.
 * Earth's Vulnerability: Keep Earth in the foreground as a stark reminder of the fragile stage for this divine drama. Show atmospheric distortion, not just light flares.
 * Color Palette: Dominated by contrasting gold/white (Aether) and deep violet/black (Oblivion), with a chaotic blend at the point of impact. The Earth itself should maintain a realistic palette to contrast with the divine spectacle. light flashing all over the place that even mortals can see it in flashes 

 * Camera Work: Start with a wide shot to establish scale, then potentially a quick, jarring zoom-in on the point of impact to convey force, before pulling back to show the cosmic repercussions.
 * 
🎵 3. Sound Design Notes
 * Impact Sound: Needs to be beyond a conventional explosion. Think cosmic thunder mixed with the sound of reality tearing. A deep, sub-bass rumble combined with a high-frequency, almost painful scream of distorted space.
 * Energy Signatures: Aether's energy should have a clean, resonant chime or hum. Oblivion's should be a deeper, more unsettling growl or crackle.
 * Earth's Tremor: A low, pervasive rumble that begins subtly and intensifies, almost like the planet itself is groaning in pain.
 * Transition to Heartbeat: The rapid shift from cosmic chaos to a singular, intimate human heartbeat is vital for establishing the narrative pivot to Earth and its mortal inhabitants. The heartbeat should be clear, prominent, and slightly amplified to symbolize the immediate focus shift.
 * 
#🎭 4. Voice Acting Directives
 * AETHER SOVEREIGN:
   * Tone: Serene, wise, powerful, ancient. His statement is not a threat, but a declaration of cosmic law. It should feel like the voice of natural order, inevitable and unyielding.
   * Delivery: Slow, deliberate, with immense gravitas. Not shouting, but resonating through the cosmos.
 * OBLIVION ARCHON:
   * Tone: Cold, absolute, menacing, but also ancient. His response is a rejection of that cosmic law, a statement of inevitable annihilation. It should feel like the voice of void, vast and consuming.
   * Delivery: Deep, guttural, with an almost bored certainty. A low rumble that echoes.
     
🌐 5. Thematic Resonance
 * Duality: Directly establishes the central theme of creation vs. destruction.
 * Mortality vs. Divinity: Positions humanity as insignificant in the face of these powers, setting up the "human ascension" theme.
 * Order vs. Chaos: Aether represents an imposed or inherent order; Oblivion represents the primal chaos that precedes and follows all order.
   
⚙️ 6. Technical Notes
 * Mythflow: The visual energy here is raw Mythflow at its purest, unadulterated state. It's the source from which all other powers (including the Avatars' abilities) will later draw.
 * Precursor Event: This scene is the "Big Bang" for the entire Mythos X universe as the audience experiences it. Its effects ripple across the entire first arc.
This detailed breakdown helps ensure that everyone working on Mythos X: Godshift understands the full scope and intent behind Scene 1, allowing for a cohesive and impactful execution.

​SETTING: Earth – various locations: bustling city streets, high-tech research labs, grimy industrial factories.
​VISUAL DESCRIPTION:
The cosmic shockwave hits Earth. Time seems to stretch and distort. Cars hover inches off the ground, their tires spinning uselessly. Streetlights flicker violently, casting an unnatural violet glow over everything. Wind freezes mid-motion, leaving leaves and dust suspended in the air. People on the streets freeze in place, looking up at the fracturing sky, their faces a mixture of confusion and terror. Inside a lab, equipment sparks wildly; in a factory, machinery grinds to a halt. The hexagonal light patterns established in Scene 1 are still visible, crisscrossing the fractured sky, intensifying the sense of a broken reality.

1. Narrative Purpose
​Introduce Protagonists & Unique Connection: Formally introduces Jax Reyes (Strength), Dr. Michael Banner (Intellect), and Kael Drayven (Darkness/Potential Avatar), highlighting their unique, resonant connections to the Mythflow.

​Initial Power Manifestation & Escalation: Visually demonstrates how the Mythquake's energy directly imprints on each character, hinting at their inherent connections to the cosmic forces of Aether and Oblivion. This isn't just power; it's a destiny activating.

​Establish Character Archetypes & Foreshadowing: Quickly conveys the core essence of each character (boxer, scientist, mechanic) but immediately shows them transcending those roles. The distinct ways they react to the Mythflow's surge directly foreshadow their eventual roles in the larger narrative as key players in the "Cosmic Race."

​Foundation for Universal Understanding: Through Dr. Banner's reaction, the scene lays the groundwork for how humanity, starting with its brightest minds, will begin to decipher the "forbidden knowledge" of the universe, moving from mundane explanations to cosmic truths.

​⚙️ 2. Visuals & Directives
​SETTING: Earth – simultaneous close-ups on three distinct individuals in their respective environments.

​VISUAL DESCRIPTION:
​JAX REYES: Mid-punch in a gritty, sweat-soaked boxing gym. As the shockwave hits, his eyes snap open, and tiny gold sparks begin to crawl up his arms, coiling around his muscles. He drops his sparring partner with an accidental, immense burst of strength. His expression is one of shock and confusion, a primal power stirring within that he doesn't comprehend. The other boxers in the gym are frozen in their own reactions to the Mythquake, oblivious to Jax's personal transformation.

​DR. MICHAEL BANNER: Hunched over complex, flickering monitors in his dimly lit, cluttered lab. His glasses are askew, pushed up slightly by his hands as he clutches his head. As the energy pulses, intricate blue glyphs begin to rotate and shimmer around his head, seemingly decoding the chaotic energy patterns suddenly flooding his screens. His initial reaction is one of scientific disbelief, quickly turning to frantic, excited awe as he realizes the data defies all known physics. He looks overwhelmed, yet also deeply fascinated.

​KAEL DRAYVEN: Underneath a broken-down vehicle in a desolate junkyard garage, covered in grease. As the violet energy ripples through the environment, his shadow seems to detach and flicker with an ominous violet flame. His eyes briefly glow a deep, unsettling purple. He feels a sudden, profound sense of emptiness and a chilling pull towards unraveling, a reflection of the Oblivion Archon's influence. He collapses to the ground, unconscious, his body subtly transforming with faint, spiraling violet sigils, unnoticed by anyone else.

​📝 1. Narrative Purpose
​First Direct Confrontation: Establishes the primary conflict between Jax and the now-corrupted Kael (Oblivion Archon).
​Demonstrate Avatar Powers: Visually showcases the raw, destructive power of the Oblivion Archon through Kael, and Jax's nascent, unrefined Aether abilities.

​Emotional Core: Jax's struggle to reach his friend, even as Kael is clearly lost, establishes the profound emotional stakes and Jax's compassionate nature.
​Divine Intervention Hint: The subtle presence of the Aether Sovereign's energy from above hints that these powers are not merely internal but connected to higher entities.
​World-Changing Stakes: The expanding destruction solidifies that this is not just a personal fight, but one that actively reshapes the world around them.

​⚙️ 2. Visuals & Directives
​SETTING: A desolate urban street, deeply fractured and smoking from the initial Mythquake. Buildings are partially collapsed, and rubble is scattered everywhere. The atmosphere is thick with dust and an eerie silence, broken only by the crackling of energy.

​VISUAL DESCRIPTION:
Kael Drayven stands amidst spreading destruction. A powerful violet aura pulsates around him, actively tearing up the asphalt and consuming cars and debris into swirling particles that vanish into nothingness. His posture is rigid, his eyes glowing an unnatural purple behind his visor, and his face a mask of cold emptiness. The outline of the Oblivion Archon hovers menacingly behind him, a dark, primal shadow of destruction made visible through his aura.

​Jax Reyes arrives, skidding to a halt on a cracked piece of road. His own gold aura flickers brightly, less controlled than Kael's, indicating his novice state. His expression is one of shock and dawning dread, a profound sadness for his friend mixed with a fierce determination. Their eyes lock across the shattered street. The ground between them shatters further as a barely contained energy ripples from their converging powers.

​From above, a faint, luminous golden light permeates the sky, subtly opposing the violet energy emanating from Kael, a silent acknowledgment of the Aether Sovereign's lingering influence. This golden light forms subtle, hexagonal patterns that try to mend the chaos, visually contrasting with Kael's destructive energy

​🎭 CHARACTER DIALOGUE & CUES
​(SOUND: GROWLING of Kael’s power, CRACKING of earth. Jax’s energy HUMS with a hesitant urgency. Distant SCREAMS from civilians just outside the immediate zone. Aether’s energy, a faint, majestic CHIME, subtly contrasts Oblivion’s deeper, menacing PULSE.)
​JAX REYES (Voice: Shocked, recognizing Kael but bewildered by his actions; a mix of his kind nature and burgeoning protective instinct, with a touch of his usual friendly, inquisitive boxer demeanor even amidst chaos):
“Yo Kael, right? What in… what are you doing?! Did you do all of this damage, bro? That ain't right, I mean, people are still out here. You know you’re glowing right? Look at you!”
​KAEL DRAYVEN / OBLIVION ARCHON (Voice: Kael's usual gruff, street-hardened tone, now infused with the Archon's cold echo. Dismissive, annoyed by Jax's chatter, seeing him as an irrelevant softie, not a threat… yet.):
“The strong clear the path. Get out of my way, pretty boy. Your glow is irritating me.”
​JAX REYES (Voice: Growing anger but also a sense of disbelieving wonder, as he becomes aware of his own power for the first time):
“You can’t just… delete everything! What’s your problem? Why are you doing this?! What glow— oooooo yeahh… wow, I am! THIS IS CRAZY, bro! Hey, Kael, why am I glowing like you?! Is it because of…”
​KAEL DRAYVEN / OBLIVION ARCHON (Voice: More of Kael’s raw cynicism comes through, amplified by Oblivion’s logic. A hint of satisfaction in his ruthless efficiency, but now, a rapidly rising irritation at Jax’s ceaseless chatter and naive questions. He cuts Jax off sharply.):
“—I’m not your brother! Move, or we’re going to have a problem, soft Jax. You always have been.”
​JAX REYES (Voice: A burst of almost joyful realization despite the danger, excited by the recognition and the prospect of a challenge. He completely ignores the threat, focusing on the shared phenomenon.):
“So you do know me, huh?! HA! I KNEW IT! You’re that street fighter, right? I heard you were the best. I’ve always wanted to fight you – not like, fight-fight, but you know… spar. So you think we’re glowing for the same reason? Is it like… a new kind of training?”
​KAEL DRAYVEN / OBLIVION ARCHON (Voice: Exploding with absolute, unbridled frustration and raw power, cutting Jax off completely. The Archon's presence becomes fully pronounced in his tone, a mix of Kael’s street rage and Oblivion’s destructive impulse.):
“PLEASE SHUT UP AND LEAVE ME ALONE!!!!!!!!!!!!!”
(SOUND: ONE MASSIVE, POWERFUL AXE KICK, accompanied by a deafening violet WHOOSH, is unleashed towards Jax. The sound gets intensely louder, and a storm begins to swell around them, the atmosphere crackling with uncontrolled Mythflow energy.)
“Or you’ll pay the ultimate price.”
​JAX REYES (Voice: A startled gasp of genuine fear and surprise, immediately followed by an almost involuntary, exhilarated laugh. His voice is tight with adrenaline, a mix of terror and thrilling challenge.):
(GASP!) “WHOA! That was…! (Excited, disbelieving laugh) That was FAST! I didn’t even see it! (A beat, then his voice drops slightly, now with a determined, focused edge, tinged with that excited wonder) But… I saw enough.”
(SOUND: A sudden, sharp, golden CRACKLE as Jax blocks or narrowly dodges the axe kick. The storm swells further. The fighting music swells to a full, driving intensity, signaling the true start of the brawl.)

​🎭 CHARACTER DIALOGUE & CUES
​(SOUND: The fighting music dies down to a heavy, ominous drone. Kael’s OBLIVION AVATAR power ROARS. Jax is on one knee, panting heavily. The Aether Sovereign's CHIME is faint, almost a whisper.)
​JAX REYES (Voice: Exhausted, struggling for breath, slightly singed, but unable to stop talking. He looks up at Kael's enormous, armored form with curiosity.):

(Panting heavily) "Whoa... okay, dude. You got armor now. That is so unfair. Is that... is that custom? Because it looks kinda bulky, bro."
​KAEL DRAYVEN / OBLIVION AVATAR (Voice: Deep, resonant, absolutely cold. Kael's voice is completely consumed by the Archon's echo now. Utterly without patience, but slightly delayed, showing the effort of containing his fury.):

"This is not a game, Jax. This is the end. You chose the path of weakness."
(SOUND: The Oblivion Avatar unleashes a sudden, heavy pressure blast of violet energy. Jax groans in pain.)

​JAX REYES (Voice: Groaning, falling further onto his knee, forcing a slightly painful laugh.):
"Ow. Yeah, no, I get it, I get it! But like, the glow. Mine's still gold, right? And yours is like, black and purple. So who gets the better color scheme, you think? I'm betting on gold."

​KAEL DRAYVEN / OBLIVION AVATAR (Voice: The Archon's echo snaps with raw irritation, his patience hitting zero. He is prepared to finish this with one final attack.):
"Your endless prattling will be the first thing I extinguish. Oblivion is silence."

​(SOUND: Kael's power screams to maximum charge. The air itself begins to crackle and disintegrate around him. The OBLIVION ARCHON's specter swells menacingly.)

​JAX REYES (Voice: Desperate, eyes closed, realizing this is the end. His voice is tight with fear, but the fighter's instinct remains.):

"I... I don't want to hurt anyone... but I can't let you hurt them, Kael."
​(SOUND: A low, ethereal WHISPER echoes in Jax’s mind. The Aether Sovereign’s voice is soft but cuts through the chaos.)

​AETHER SOVEREIGN (Voice: Soft, but commanding, ethereal, heard only by Jax):
"Creation is not mercy... it's choice."
​JAX REYES (Voice: A sudden, sharp inhale. A gasp of realization, not just power.):

"Choice."
​(SOUND: A sudden, immense GOLDEN CHIME erupts from Jax. His sputtering aura ROARS back to life. The heavy drone of Kael's power is momentarily drowned out. Debris WHOOSHES upwards, reversing course. The sound of FIRES SIZZLING and suddenly extinguishing.)

​KAEL DRAYVEN / OBLIVION AVATAR (Voice: Absolute shock and rage, the Archon's echo cracking with disbelief at the resistance.):
"IMPOSSIBLE! You are nothing!"

​JAX REYES (Voice: RISING. Loud, strong, and centered. The confidence he has always lacked is suddenly present, fueled by the Aether's spark. He doesn't have the final form, but he has the strength to stand.):
"Wrong. I'm choosing to stand up. (A moment of intense, focused effort) Let's see how much silence you can handle!"

​(SOUND: A powerful GOLDEN CONCUSSION BLAST pushes Kael back miles. The fighting music EXPLODES into a renewed, epic theme, signaling the final confrontation has begun.)

​⚙️ 2. Visuals & Directives
​SETTING: High above the devastated city, reaching into the lower atmosphere. The sky is a tumultuous canvas of clashing golden and violet Mythflow energy. The moon is still present, an enormous, silent witness.

​VISUAL DESCRIPTION:
​(PHASE 1: Ascent and Initial Clash - 17:00-19:00)
Both Avatars, Jax (now radiating intense, unstable golden energy, covered in glowing sigils but still in his base form) and Kael (in his full OBLIVION AVATAR form), ascend rapidly into the sky. Their initial movements are incredibly fast, blurring trails of gold and violet light. Kael's attacks are wide, devastating sweeps of void energy that rip through the air, while Jax counters with precise, powerful golden energy blasts and swift martial arts, imbued with temporary Aether force.

​Behind Kael, the OBLIVION ARCHON looms, constantly pushing destructive energy through him, urging him to greater devastation. Behind Jax, the AETHER SOVEREIGN glows brighter, its form resolute, channeling defensive and constructive Mythflow into Jax, subtly protecting him and empowering his counter-attacks.

​As they climb higher, the destruction below the city becomes a backdrop, emphasized by the continuing storm. Kael aims to cause maximum damage to the world, while Jax focuses on containing his power and defending.
​KEY VISUAL (Image #6 - Part 1: Ascent and Initial Clash):


​🎭 CHARACTER DIALOGUE & CUES
​(SOUND: The fighting music swells to a full, driving, orchestral intensity. Both Avatars' powers ROAR. A storm of Mythflow energy RAGES around them as they ascend.)

​KAEL DRAYVEN / OBLIVION AVATAR (Voice: Deep, cold, filled with absolute certainty of his mission. The Archon's echo is perfectly fused with his own ruthless voice.):
"You cling to a dying world, Jax. Let it go. This is its cleansing."
​JAX REYES (Voice: Strained, but firm, fueled by the Aether's spark. He's still Jax, but with new confidence and a profound sense of purpose. Every word is a struggle against the overwhelming power.):
"No way! This isn't 'cleansing,' Kael! This is just... wrecking everything! I'm not letting you take anyone else!"

​(SOUND: Violent power clashes. EXPLOSIONS of golden and violet energy. City below groans.)

​KAEL DRAYVEN / OBLIVION AVATAR (Voice: A cold sneer, mocking Jax's compassion. His attacks become more furious.):

"Still playing the hero, boxer? The world doesn't need saviors. It needs to be remade. And I am the architect of its undoing."
​(SOUND: Kael's power screams as he tears open a massive, jagged BLACK RIFT in reality itself. The sound is like fabric being violently ripped, combined with a deep, consuming VOID RUMBLE.)

​JAX REYES (Voice: Alarm and desperation in his voice as he sees the rift forming, but quickly steeling himself. He's trying to think like a fighter, even against cosmic destruction.):

"A rift?! Whoa, that's a big move! Okay, okay, uh... gotta close that up!"
​(SOUND: Jax’s Aether energy ROARS, a pure, harmonious CHIME. He channels a powerful Aether Burst. The sound is like concentrated light and force, pushing against the void.)

​KAEL DRAYVEN / OBLIVION AVATAR (Voice: A guttural laugh, filled with dark triumph.):
"Futility! Behold the Null Vector Collapse!"
​(SOUND: Kael's attack, a deep, consuming VOID RUMBLE, clashes directly with 

Jax's Aether Burst. A moment of deafening, almost painful SILENCE as energies compress.)
​NARRATOR (Voice: Solemn, impactful. Over the profound silence, then a gradual build of sound):
“When gods fall… humanity rises.”
​(SOUND: The SILENCE shatters. A DEAFENING, CRACKLING EXPLOSION as the white sphere forms and rapidly expands. The MOON itself seems to CRACK visually. All sound becomes distorted, compressed, then begins to fade into a lingering cosmic reverberation.)

​⚙️ 2. Visuals & Directives
​SETTING: Dr. Banner's ruined, makeshift lab. It's a small, contained space littered with shattered equipment, twisted metal, and flickering monitors. The desolate cityscape from the battle forms a hazy, ruined backdrop through a broken window.
​VISUAL DESCRIPTION:
Dr. Banner (battered, glasses crooked, clothes singed, but driven) is hunched over a single, still-operational monitor displaying highly complex, oscillating energy signatures that match the chaos of the collapsing white sphere (from Scene 6).
​As he stares, a small, crystalline fragment of raw, glowing energy (a mixture of gold and violet light, shimmering with faint, erratic sigils) drifts down from the smoke outside and comes to rest gently in his outstretched hand. He examines it with an expression of profound scientific awe and curiosity, oblivious to his surroundings.
​On his other monitors, now barely functional and severely cracked, cryptic text begins to flicker rapidly, bypassing firewalls and displaying a single, ominous message: WELLSPRING_PROTOCOL_01 — ACTIVE.

*All assets, storyboards, and reference images are embedded directly from the repo. Animators: use the **Visual Directives** as shot-by-shot briefs. Readers: enjoy the cinematic script with integrated key art. Enhanced for legendary status: mythic why-now, lived-in world, active geniuses, personal stakes, tragic triggers, and iconic artifacts. Now amplified with dramatic DBZ-inspired rivalry—Jax as the pure-hearted, everyman fighter like Goku (kind, excited by challenges, unbreakable spirit), Kael as a prideful, street-hardened anti-hero turned villain like Vegeta (arrogant, ruthless, seeking dominance) fused with Luke Cage's unbreakable toughness and urban grit, creating a massive villain persona that's tragic, unstoppable, and magnetically antagonistic. The storyline pulses with escalating tension, emotional betrayal, and explosive power-ups, making this a pulse-pounding anime pilot.*

## EP01_SC01 — **The Mythquake Clash**  
**Runtime:** 00:00–01:20 (incl. title card)  

![SC01 Key Art](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/0cdf680d-db57-42dc-968e-c07a20e560c5)

### 1. Narrative Purpose  
- **Inciting Incident** – The “big bang” of the Mythos X universe. For eons they were bound; today, the seal shattered, awakening the eternal clash and igniting a dramatic rivalry that echoes through mortals.  
- **Core Conflict** – Creation (Aether Sovereign) vs. Destruction (Oblivion Archon), mirroring the Goku-Vegeta dynamic on a cosmic scale: Aether's balanced heroism vs. Oblivion's prideful annihilation.  
- **Stakes** – Planet-altering consequences visible **globally**, setting up Jax and Kael's parallel awakenings as avatars of this divine feud.  
- **Tone** – Epic, high-stakes sci-fantasy. *Bang. Bang. Bang.* Mortals worldwide look skyward: *“What the hell is that?!”* — foreshadowing the human drama to come.

### 2. Visual Directives (Animators)  
| Element | Description |  
|---------|-------------|  
| **Aether Sovereign** | Luminous, crystalline gold/white energy. Clean lines, precise attacks—like Goku's pure, focused Kamehameha. |  
| **Oblivion Archon** | Chaotic, spiky violet/black entropy. Attacks tear reality—like Vegeta's explosive, pride-driven Final Flash. |  
| **Impact** | Reality-warping **shockwave** – spacetime ripples, hexagonal sky fractures. |  
| **Earth** | Foreground, realistic palette. Atmosphere distorts; light flashes mortals can see. |  
| **Camera** | Wide → jarring zoom → pull back. |  

### 3. Sound Design  
- **Impact:** Cosmic thunder + reality-tearing scream.  
- **Aether:** Resonant chime.  
- **Oblivion:** Crackling growl.  
- **Earth:** Groaning sub-bass.  
- **Transition:** Cosmic chaos → single human **heartbeat**.

### 4. Voice Acting  
| Character | Tone | Delivery |  
|-----------|------|----------|  
| **Aether Sovereign** | Serene, ancient, inevitable—like Goku's calm resolve | Slow, resonant declaration |  
| **Oblivion Archon** | Cold, void-like, bored certainty—like Vegeta's arrogant sneer | Deep, guttural echo |  

### 5. Script  
```  
(SOUND: CRACKING reality, DEAFENING THUD, COSMIC ROAR → silence. Sky fractures into HEXAGONS.)  

**NARRATOR** (solemn, echoing faintly over the clash)  
“For eons they were bound. Today, the seal shattered—igniting a rivalry that will consume worlds.”  

**AETHER SOVEREIGN**  
“Creation demands balance.”  

**OBLIVION ARCHON**  
“Then let balance die.”  

(SOUND: Reverberation builds → distant human panic.)  

**CIVILIAN 1** (overlapping)  
“What… what IS that?!”  

**CIVILIAN 2**  
“The sky! It’s splitting—end of days!”  

**CIVILIAN 3** (tripping)  
“RUN!”  

(SOUND: Chaos crescendo → fades into heartbeat.)  
```

## EP01_SC02 — **The Aftershock**  
**Runtime:** 01:20–03:00  

![SC02 Key Art](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a0fcb594-5f61-4000-89ac-53c029f79cf0)

### 1. Narrative Purpose  
- Humanize cosmic impact, building dramatic tension as everyday lives shatter.  
- Global anomaly → bridge to Awakening, hinting at past events that fuel the rivalry's inevitability.  
- Narrator hook: *“Some… hear the call.”* — teasing Jax and Kael's destined clash.

### 2. Visuals  
- **Locations:** City streets, labs, factories.  
- **Effects:** Cars hover, lights flicker violet, leaves freeze, hexagonal sky web.  

### 3. Script  
```  
(TRANSITION: Cosmic sounds → heartbeat.)  

**CIVILIAN 4** (frantic)  
“My car! It’s… floating?!”  

**CIVILIAN 5**  
“Giant spiderweb in the sky!”  

**CIVILIAN 6** (child)  
“Pretty colors, Mommy…”  

**NEWS ANCHOR** (distant TV static, overlapping panic)  
“This is not the first anomaly. Reports match the 1977 ‘Silent Flash’ over Tokyo… could this be the rivalry's return?”  

**NARRATOR** (urgent sports-announcer)  
“When gods clash, mortals tremble. But some… hear the call—and rise to rival it.”  
```

### 1. Narrative Purpose  
- Introduce **Jax (Strength)** as Goku-like: kind-hearted boxer with naive excitement and unbreakable spirit. **Banner (Intellect)** as the analytical bridge. **Kael (Darkness)** as Vegeta-Luke Cage fusion: prideful, unbreakable street fighter with a tragic scar of past failures, turning him into a massive villain driven by dominance and resentment.

### 2. Visuals (per character)  
| Character | Environment | Effect |  
|---------|-------------|--------|  
| **Jax** | Boxing gym | Gold sparks coil muscles → accidental KO; wide-eyed grin like Goku discovering Super Saiyan. |  
| **Banner** | Lab | Blue glyphs rotate around head → data overload; monitor flashes "MYTHFLOW RESONANCE: 99.7%". |  
| **Kael** | Junkyard | Faint violet scar on wrist (unbreakable skin crack) glows; shadow detaches, violet sigils → collapse with a prideful snarl. |  

### 3. Script Highlights  
```  
**JAX REYES** (mid-punch, eyes snapping open as gold sparks ignite)  
(Grunts in shock, then excited laugh) “Whoa! This power… it’s like nothing I’ve felt! Gotta get stronger!” (Accidental burst KO’s partner.)  

**DR. BANNER** (clutching head, frantic typing)  
“Rerouting quantum lattice—come on, isolate the frequency!”  
(Monitor: MYTHFLOW RESONANCE: 99.7%)  
“That’s not possible… unless the old rivalries are real.”  

**KAEL DRAYVEN** (under car, violet scar glowing, clenching fist)  
(Gruff whisper, pride cracking) “Not again… this time, I’ll crush everything in my way.”  
(Shadow detaches; collapses with violet sigils, unbreakable aura flickering like Luke Cage's skin.)  
```

### 1. Narrative Purpose  
- First Avatar clash, dripping with dramatic rivalry: Jax's Goku-like camaraderie vs. Kael's Vegeta-like disdain and Luke Cage grit, building betrayal tension.  
- Emotional core: Jax trying to reach his "rival" friend, while Kael's pride spirals into villainy.  
- World-scale stakes, with Kael's unbreakable destruction ramping up the drama.

### 2. Script  
```  
**JAX** (shocked, but Goku-like friendly grin)  
“Yo Kael, what are you doing, bro? We were supposed to spar someday—you’re the unbreakable street king I’ve heard about!”  

**KAEL/OBLIVION** (cold sneer, Vegeta arrogance fused with Cage's grit)  
“The strong clear the path. Move, weakling. You’re not worthy of my power.”  

**JAX** (excited, eyes widening at shared glow)  
“Wait—WE’RE BOTH GLOWING! This is like that ultimate training I’ve dreamed of! Come on, rival—let’s figure this out together!”  

**KAEL/OBLIVION** (exploding with prideful rage)  
“PLEASE SHUT UP AND LEAVE ME ALONE!!!!!!!!!!!!! You’re nothing but a naive fool—I’ll crush you like the rest!”  

(SOUND: Massive violet AXE KICK → storm swells, Kael's unbreakable aura shattering concrete like Luke Cage rampaging.)  
```

- Theme: *Choice* over mercy, with Jax's spirit refusing to let his rival fall completely.

### 2. Script  
```  
**JAX** (panting, Goku-like determination)  
“You got armor now. That is so unfair… but Kael, we’re rivals, not enemies! My little sister’s school is two blocks from here—you can’t just destroy everything!”  

**KAEL/OBLIVION** (Vegeta sneer, unbreakable Cage menace)  
“This is not a game, Jax. This is the end. You chose the path of weakness—I choose dominance.”  

**JAX** (groaning, but forcing a laugh)  
“Ow… yeah, gold vs. purple. But I won’t let you go full villain on me, bro!”  

**AETHER SOVEREIGN** (whisper in mind)  
“Creation is not mercy… it’s choice.”  

**JAX** (rising, unbreakable spirit igniting)  
“Wrong. I’m choosing to stand up—for you, for everyone. Let’s see if your pride can handle a real fight!”  

(SOUND: GOLDEN CONCUSSION BLAST → epic theme swells.)  
```
