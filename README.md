**FADE IN:**

**EXT. COSMIC VOID - DAY (00:00–01:20)**  

*The vast emptiness of space. Earth hangs fragile in the foreground. Suddenly, two colossal entities materialize: AETHER SOVEREIGN (luminous gold/white, crystalline form, precise and heroic like Goku's resolve) and OBLIVION ARCHON (chaotic violet/black, spiky entropy, explosive like Vegeta's pride). Their fists clash in a reality-warping impact—shockwaves ripple through spacetime, fracturing the sky into hexagonal patterns visible from Earth. Light flashes globally, mortals staring up in terror.*

**(SOUND: CRACKING reality, DEAFENING THUD, COSMIC ROAR → silence. Sky fractures into HEXAGONS. Aether's resonant chime vs. Oblivion's crackling growl.)**

**NARRATOR (V.O.)**  
(solemn, echoing)  
“For eons they were bound. Today, the seal shattered—igniting a rivalry that will consume worlds.”  

**AETHER SOVEREIGN**  
(serene, ancient, like Goku's calm)  
“Creation demands balance.”  

**OBLIVION ARCHON**  
(cold sneer, like Vegeta's arrogance)  
“Then let balance die.”  

*The shockwave hits Earth: atmosphere distorts, lights flash. Cut to global panic—people in cities, fields, everywhere looking up.*

**(SOUND: Reverberation builds → distant human panic. Earth's groaning sub-bass.)**

**CIVILIAN 1** (panicked, overlapping)  
“What… what IS that?!”  

**CIVILIAN 2** (terrified)  
“The sky! It’s splitting—end of days!”  

**CIVILIAN 3** (tripping in panic)  
“Run! EVERYONE RUN!!!!!”  

**(SOUND: Chaos crescendo → final cosmic reverberation fades into a single, intimate HUMAN HEARTBEAT.)**

**TITLE CARD: MYTHOS X: GODSHIFT - EPISODE 1: HEAVENFALL**

**CUT TO:**

**EXT./INT. EARTH - VARIOUS LOCATIONS - CONTINUOUS (01:20–03:00)**  

*The aftershock ripples: cars hover, streetlights flicker violet, leaves freeze mid-air. Hexagonal patterns web the sky. In bustling streets, labs, factories—panic ensues. Time stretches, reality bends.*

![Aftershock Panic](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a0fcb594-5f61-4000-89ac-53c029f79cf0)

**(SOUND: Cosmic hum → low unsettling drone. Wind-chime vibrations. Distant shouts.)**

**CIVILIAN 4** (frantic woman, staring at hovering car)  
“My car! It’s… floating? What’s happening?!”  

**CIVILIAN 5** (incredulous man, pointing skyward)  
“Look! It’s still there! Like a giant spiderweb in the sky—this isn’t good, man!”  

**CIVILIAN 6** (child, 4-5, innocent awe)  
“Look Mommy, pretty colors…”  

*A distant TV blares amid the chaos.*

**NEWS ANCHOR (V.O.)** (static-laced, urgent)  
“This is not the first anomaly. Reports match the 1977 ‘Silent Flash’ over Tokyo… could this be the rivalry's return?”  

**NARRATOR (V.O.)** (urgent, like a sports announcer)  
“When gods clash, mortals tremble. But some… hear the call—and rise to rival it.”  

![Global Anomaly](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/614b6dc8-7434-4d0f-b43d-2717a2864d84)

**(SOUND: Drone fades → subtle pulse grows. Transition to distinct character sounds.)**

**CUT TO:**

**INT./EXT. EARTH - SIMULTANEOUS CLOSE-UPS (03:00–06:00)**  

*Three parallel awakenings, intercut for tension.*

**JAX REYES (mid-20s, kind-hearted boxer, Goku-like spirit) in a gritty gym, mid-punch on a sparring partner. Shockwave hits—gold sparks crawl up his arms, coiling muscles. He drops his partner with an accidental burst. Wide-eyed grin of excitement amid shock.*

![Jax Awakening](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ab238405-ed16-44ea-9a42-9df3470f1d38)

**JAX**  
(grunts in shock, then excited laugh)  
“Whoa! This power… it’s like nothing I’ve felt! Gotta get stronger!”  

*(Other boxers freeze, oblivious to his transformation.)*

**DR. MICHAEL BANNER (30s, glasses askew, analytical genius) in cluttered lab, over flickering monitors. Energy pulses—blue glyphs shimmer around his head, decoding chaotic data. He types frantically, overwhelmed yet fascinated.*

![Banner Awakening](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a2d657f8-7f3c-4a66-a52e-41026c174974)

**BANNER**  
(clutching head)  
“Rerouting quantum lattice—come on, isolate the frequency!”  

*(Monitor flashes: MYTHFLOW RESONANCE: 99.7%)*  

**BANNER** (continued)  
“That’s not possible… unless the old rivalries are real.”  

**KAEL DRAYVEN (mid-20s, grease-covered mechanic, Vegeta-Luke Cage fusion: prideful, unbreakable grit) under a junkyard vehicle. Violet energy ripples—faint scar on wrist glows, shadow detaches with ominous flame. Eyes glow purple; he feels emptiness, collapses with spiraling sigils.*

![Kael Awakening](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/1eb3c1c0-29a8-476c-afaa-e7981ceed3b8)

**KAEL**  
(gruff whisper, pride cracking, clenching fist)  
“Not again… this time, I’ll crush everything in my way.”  

*(Unbreakable aura flickers like Luke Cage's skin; he passes out unnoticed.)*

**(SOUND: For Jax: Golden hum building. Banner: Digital beeps escalating. Kael: Menacing violet pulse. Intercut builds tension.)**

**CUT TO:**

**EXT. DESOLATE URBAN STREET - LATER (06:00–10:00)**  

*Fractured, smoking from Mythquake. Kael stands amid destruction, violet aura tearing asphalt, consuming debris into nothingness. Rigid posture, glowing eyes, cold mask. Oblivion Archon's shadow looms behind. Jax skids in, gold aura flickering novice-like. Eyes lock—ground shatters between them. Faint golden sky light opposes violet.*

![Kael's Rebellion Alt](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/1864b931-de63-4138-90fa-94fd4c98a43d)

**(SOUND: Kael’s growling power, cracking earth. Jax’s hesitant hum. Distant screams. Aether’s faint chime vs. Oblivion’s pulse.)**

**JAX** (shocked, Goku-like friendly grin)  
“Yo Kael, right? What in… what are you doing?! Did you do all of this damage, bro? That ain't right, I mean, people are still out here. You know you’re glowing right? Look at you! We were supposed to spar someday—you’re the unbreakable street king I’ve heard about!”  

**KAEL/OBLIVION** (cold sneer, Vegeta arrogance fused with Cage's grit)  
“The strong clear the path. Get out of my way, pretty boy. Your glow is irritating me. You’re not worthy of my power.”  

**JAX** (growing anger, disbelieving wonder)  
“You can’t just… delete everything! What’s your problem? Why are you doing this?! What glow— oooooo yeahh… wow, I am! THIS IS CRAZY, bro! Hey, Kael, why am I glowing like you?! Is it because of… Wait—WE’RE BOTH GLOWING! This is like that ultimate training I’ve dreamed of! Come on, rival—let’s figure this out together!”  

**KAEL/OBLIVION** (Kael’s cynicism amplified, irritation rising)  
“—I’m not your brother! Move, or we’re going to have a problem, soft Jax. You always have been. You’re nothing but a naive fool—I’ll crush you like the rest!”  

**JAX** (joyful realization, ignoring threat)  
“So you do know me, huh?! HA! I KNEW IT! You’re that street fighter, right? I heard you were the best. I’ve always wanted to fight you – not like, fight-fight, but you know… spar. So you think we’re glowing for the same reason? Is it like… a new kind of training?”  

**KAEL/OBLIVION** (exploding rage, Archon fully pronounced)  
“PLEASE SHUT UP AND LEAVE ME ALONE!!!!!!!!!!!!!”  

*(Massive violet AXE KICK unleashes—whoosh, storm swells. Kael's unbreakable aura shatters concrete like Luke Cage rampaging.)*

**KAEL/OBLIVION** (continued)  
“Or you’ll pay the ultimate price.”  

**JAX** (startled gasp, then exhilarated laugh)  
(GASP!) “WHOA! That was…! (Laugh) That was FAST! I didn’t even see it! (Determined edge) But… I saw enough.”  

*(Sharp golden crackle—Jax blocks/dodges. Storm swells further. Fighting music explodes.)*

**CUT TO:**

**EXT. DEVASTATED STREET - CONTINUOUS (10:00–17:00)**  

*Battle rages. Jax on one knee, panting, singed. Kael in full OBLIVION AVATAR: enormous armored form, violet energy roaring. Jax's aura sputters; Kael's dominates.*

![Battle Intensity](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/421ff829-9571-45a2-a023-abe81c17e482)

**(SOUND: Fighting music to ominous drone. Kael’s roar. Jax pants heavily. Aether’s faint chime.)**

**JAX** (exhausted, still chatty)  
(Panting) "Whoa... okay, dude. You got armor now. That is so unfair. Is that... is that custom? Because it looks kinda bulky, bro. But Kael, we’re rivals, not enemies! My little sister’s school is two blocks from here—you can’t just destroy everything!”  

**KAEL/OBLIVION** (deep, cold, patience gone)  
"This is not a game, Jax. This is the end. You chose the path of weakness—I choose dominance.”  

*(Heavy violet pressure blast—Jax groans.)*

**JAX** (painful laugh)  
"Ow. Yeah, no, I get it, I get it! But like, the glow. Mine's still gold, right? And yours is like, black and purple. So who gets the better color scheme, you think? I'm betting on gold. But I won’t let you go full villain on me, bro!”  

**KAEL/OBLIVION** (fury peaking)  
"Your endless prattling will be the first thing I extinguish. Oblivion is silence."  

*(Kael charges max—air disintegrates. Oblivion specter swells.)*

**JAX** (desperate, eyes closed)  
"I... I don't want to hurt anyone... but I can't let you hurt them, Kael."  

**(SOUND: Ethereal whisper in Jax’s mind.)**

**AETHER SOVEREIGN (V.O.)** (soft, commanding)  
"Creation is not mercy... it's choice."  

**JAX** (sharp inhale, realization)  
"Choice."  

*(Immense golden chime erupts—Jax's aura roars back. Debris reverses, fires extinguish.)*

**KAEL/OBLIVION** (shock, rage)  
"IMPOSSIBLE! You are nothing!"  

**JAX** (rising, confident surge)  
"Wrong. I’m choosing to stand up—for you, for everyone. Let’s see if your pride can handle a real fight!”  

*(Powerful golden concussion blast pushes Kael back miles. Epic theme swells—final confrontation begins.)*

**CUT TO:**

**EXT. HIGH ATMOSPHERE - CLIMAX (17:00–22:00)**  

*Avatars ascend: Jax (unstable gold sigils, base form) vs. Kael (full Avatar). Blurring trails—Kael's wide void sweeps, Jax's precise martial blasts. Archons loom behind: Oblivion pushing destruction, Aether channeling defense.*

![Rift Formation](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/421ff829-9571-45a2-a023-abe81c17e482)

**(SOUND: Orchestral intensity. Power roars. Storm rages.)**

**KAEL/OBLIVION** (arrogant roar)  
"You cling to a dying world, Jax. Let it go. This is its cleansing—I am unbreakable!”  

**JAX** (strained, resolve)  
"No way! This isn't 'cleansing,' Kael! I won’t let my rival destroy what we could protect together!”  

*(Violent clashes. City groans below.)*

**KAEL/OBLIVION** (sneer, furious)  
"Still playing the hero, boxer? The world doesn't need saviors. It needs to be remade. And I am the architect of its undoing."  

*(Kael tears open massive BLACK RIFT—void rumble, fabric ripping.)*

**KAEL/OBLIVION** (continued)  
"Futility! Behold the Null Vector Collapse!"  

**JAX** (alarm, steeling self)  
"A rift?! Whoa, that's a big move! Okay, okay, uh... gotta close that up!"  

*(Jax channels Aether Burst—harmonious chime pushes back.)*

*(Energies compress—deafening silence.)*

**NARRATOR (V.O.)** (solemn)  
“When gods fall… humanity rises. And from their collision was born… the Genesis Seed.”  

*(Silence shatters—crackling explosion. White sphere expands, moon cracks visually. Sound distorts, fades to reverberation.)*

**FADE OUT.**

**POST-CREDIT SEQUENCE (22:00–22:40)**  

**INT. BANNER'S RUINED LAB - NIGHT**  

*Banner (battered, driven) over operational monitor: oscillating signatures from the sphere. A glowing mythflow fragment (gold-violet crystal) drifts into his hand. Awe fills his face.*

"This changes everything..."  

**FADE TO BLACK.**
