SCENE 1 — THE MYTHQUAKE CLASH (00:00–01:20)
​SETTING: Outer space, high above Earth’s atmosphere. The cosmos bends under golden and violet energy storms.
​VISUAL: Two titanic, ethereal figures, one blazing gold (AETHER SOVEREIGN) and one shadowy violet (OBLIVION ARCHON), collide with unimaginable force. Their fists meet, generating a shockwave that distorts the fabric of space-time around Earth. The planet below trembles violently.

SCENE 2 — THE AFTERSHOCK (01:20–03:00)
​SETTING: Earth – various locations: bustling city streets, high-tech research labs, grimy industrial factories.
​VISUAL: The cosmic shockwave hits Earth. Time seems to stretch and distort. Cars hover inches off the ground, their tires spinning uselessly. Streetlights flicker violently, casting an unnatural violet glow over everything. Wind freezes mid-motion, leaving leaves and dust suspended in the air. People on the streets freeze in place, looking up at the fracturing sky, their faces a mixture of confusion and terror. Inside a lab, equipment sparks wildly; in a factory, machinery grinds to a halt.

SCENE 3 — THE AWAKENING BELOW (03:00–06:00)
​SETTING: Earth – simultaneous close-ups on three distinct individuals.
​VISUAL:
​JAX REYES: Mid-punch in a gritty, sweat-soaked boxing gym. As the shockwave hits, his eyes snap open, and tiny gold sparks begin to crawl up his arms, coiling around his muscles. He drops his sparring partner with an accidental, immense burst of strength.
​DR. MICHAEL BANNER: Hunched over complex, flickering monitors in his dimly lit, cluttered lab. His glasses are askew. As the energy pulses, intricate blue glyphs begin to rotate and shimmer around his head, seemingly decoding the chaotic energy patterns on his screens. He clutches his head, overwhelmed by the sudden influx of information.
​KAEL DRAYVEN: Underneath a broken-down vehicle in a desolate junkyard garage, covered in grease. As the violet energy ripples, his shadow seems to detach and flicker with an ominous violet flame. His eyes briefly glow a deep, unsettling purple. He feels a sudden, profound sense of emptiness, a pull towards unraveling.

SCENE 4 — KAEL’S REBELLION (06:00–10:00)
​SETTING: A desolate urban street, fractured and smoking from the Mythquake.
​VISUAL: Kael Drayven stands amidst spreading destruction. A powerful violet aura tears up the asphalt around him, consuming cars and debris into swirling particles. His voice, now deeper and echoing, is overlaid with the cold, resonant tone of the Oblivion Archon. He is no longer himself. Jax Reyes arrives, his own gold aura flickering brightly around him, his expression one of shock and dawning dread. Their eyes lock. The ground between them shatters as a barely contained energy ripples.

 SCENE 5 — THE AETHER UNLEASHED (10:00–17:00)
​SETTING: The same devastated urban street.
​VISUAL: Jax Reyes falls to one knee, overwhelmed by Kael's power. His golden aura sputters. Just as he seems on the verge of collapse, a whisper, the voice of the Aether Sovereign, echoes directly into his mind: "Creation is not mercy... it's choice." Golden sigils begin to spread rapidly across Jax's body, not just his skin, but forming into intricate, glowing geometric armor. Debris around him reverses direction, floating upwards; small, spreading fires unburn themselves and vanish. The AETHER FORM activates, enveloping Jax in luminous, radiant armor, perfectly matching the visual style of your Aether Sovereign in the character card. He rises, now a beacon of order.

SCENE 6 — HEAVENFALL (17:00–22:00)
​SETTING: High above the devastated city, reaching into the lower atmosphere.
​VISUAL: Both Avatars, Jax (in AETHER FORM) and Kael (as OBLIVION ARCHON), ascend into the sky. Kael's form expands, tearing open a massive, jagged black rift in reality itself, threatening to swallow the city whole. Jax's Aether Form shines even brighter, his power radiating fractal golden light that attempts to seal the rift, a battle of pure cosmic will. Their dual energy attacks collide: a powerful Aether Burst of pure golden light from Jax meets Kael's devastating Null Vector Collapse—a cone of absolute darkness that devours light and matter. The collision creates an expanding white sphere of compressed energy and void. Everything within the sphere seems to stop, frozen in an impossible moment.

POST-CREDIT SEQUENCE
​SETTING: Dr. Banner's ruined, makeshift lab, a desolate cityscape in the background.
​VISUAL: Dr. Banner, battered but alive, watches the distant, chaotic energy signature of the collapsing white sphere on a cracked monitor. A small fragment of raw, glowing energy (a mixture of gold and violet) drifts from the aftermath and comes to rest gently in his hand. He examines it with a mixture of awe and scientific curiosity. On his other monitors, now barely functional, cryptic text flickers into existence: WELLSPRING_PROTOCOL_01 — ACTIVE.
