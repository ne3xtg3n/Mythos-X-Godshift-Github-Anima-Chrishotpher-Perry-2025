# Mythos X: Godshift  
## Pilot Episode 0 — **Before Heavenfall**  
### Full Episode Script — 22-Minute Runtime  
*By Christopher Perry — 2025*  
*This is the  prequel pilot episode script, setting the stage for Episode 1: Heavenfall. This 22-minute anime episode with cosmic rivalries, high-stakes drama, and visual spectacle. Cassian embodies a heroic, light-speed guardian (foreshadowing Jax's pure-hearted strength), while Lorcan fuses dark ambition and unbreakable force (precursor to Kael's Vegeta-Luke Cage villainy). The storyline builds tension through godly drills, rebellion, and catastrophe, leading directly into the Mythquake of Episode 1. Images integrated for visual storytelling—optimized for GitHub to make this repo a shining anime showcase.*

*“Before the fall, there was the fracture.”*

**FADE IN:**

**EXT. AETHERIA - CITY OF THE GODS - ETERNAL DAY (00:00–03:00)**  

*The majestic floating city of Aetheria gleams in eternal light, spires of crystalline gold piercing endless clouds. Power hums like currency in the air. CASSIAN (golden-armored, agile warrior with light-speed grace, heroic like a proto-Jax) dashes through the sky, fists blazing with pure luminous energy. LORCAN (shadow-clad, massive build with unshakable force, dark and prideful like a proto-Kael) stands firm, his form rippling with violet entropy. This is a Mythquake drill—a ritual clash of rivals. But tension crackles like a live wire; Lorcan's eyes burn with contempt for the rules binding their power.*

![Mythquake Drill](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b6c4341c-c6a4-4d4f-b418-29ece43f9bea)

**(SOUND: Whistling wind from Cassian's speed, deep rumbles from Lorcan's impacts. Cosmic thunder echoes with each clash. Epic orchestral build.)**

**LORCAN** (low rumble, sneering contempt)  
“Still clinging to the laws, Cassian? Those chains keep our true potential caged—like weaklings afraid of their own strength.”  

**CASSIAN** (calm resolve, mid-dash, voice steady like a guardian's oath)  
“The laws protect the balance, Lorcan. Without them, we'd destroy everything we guard. Focus—show me your force!”  

*Cassian strikes with a blinding light punch. Lorcan braces, absorbing the hit. Shockwave tears through the sky, fracturing clouds into faint hexagonal patterns—foreshadowing the greater quake to come. Lorcan remains unbeaten, but his satisfaction fades; he craves the Archons' limitless power.*

**LORCAN** (gritting, pushing back with a shadow-infused counter)  
“Balance? That's your excuse for holding back. I want the power to crush any threat—not play these games!”  

*The ground quivers—not from their fists, but a deep, ancient thrumming from below. Lorcan glares at the flawless city, his gaze on the tremor.*

**(SOUND: Subtle seismic rumble builds, overlaying the fight's impacts. Transition to ominous hum.)**

**CUT TO:**

**INT. AETHERIA'S CORE CHAMBER - CONTINUOUS (03:00–06:00)**  

*ARCHONIA (ancient, regal Archon of Aetheria, wise and commanding) stands in the glowing heart of the city, surrounded by holographic energy maps. She feels the tremor in her bones— this is no drill; it's a rupture in reality. Far below, in the suppressed world, ancient powers stir: The Awakening Below. Her hand raises, sending a silent alarm to the highest echelons. The chamber shakes slightly, lights flickering violet-gold.*

![Archonia's Alarm](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b0560c95-4368-489c-bdfd-8be051e05554)

**(SOUND: Alarms blare subtly, core thrumming intensifies. Ethereal chimes signal the alert.)**

**ARCHONIA** (urgent, voice echoing with authority)  
“This tremor... it's not ours. The seals are weakening. The world below awakens—demanding what we've long suppressed.”  

*Cut back to the drill: Archonia's voice booms over comms, calling it off.*

**ARCHONIA (V.O.)** (firm)  
“Cease the Mythquake drill! Unstable core detected. Return to stations—all warriors!”  

*Lorcan smirks, seeing opportunity in the chaos. Cassian pauses, concerned.*

**LORCAN** (sneering, under breath)  
“Unstable? Or vulnerable? You hold back the power that could stop any threat, yet you fear the ground shaking.”  

**CUT TO:**

**EXT. AETHERIA SKYLINE - IMMEDIATELY AFTER (06:00–10:00)**  

*Lorcan declares his rebellion, shattering the peace. He turns from Cassian, facing the churning darkness below the city. His aura flares violet, shadows coiling like unbreakable chains. Cassian reaches out, but Lorcan shrugs him off with prideful disdain.*

![Lorcan's Declaration](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/5da769c1-f2cf-4731-98a5-efde73de577d)

**(SOUND: Dramatic swell—Lorcan's growl builds to a roar. City alarms wail in the background.)**

**LORCAN** (defiant, voice booming)  
“The only law I follow is the law of strength! If the Archons won't unleash our true power, I'll take it myself. This 'balance' ends now—Kael’s Rebellion begins!”  

**CASSIAN** (shocked, trying to reason)  
“Lorcan, wait! This tremor—it's a sign. Rebelling now could doom us all!”  

*Lorcan ignores him, plunging toward the city's energy main—a glowing conduit of raw cosmic power. With a guttural shout, he rips the seals from his own power core, hand diving into the main. He consumes it, body reshaping in a terrifying surge.*

![Power Consumption](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/7f43ae13-859f-4a09-8f09-69746243b929)

**(SOUND: Violent energy whoosh, crackling overload. Lorcan's agonized roar turns triumphant.)**

**LORCAN** (ecstatic, power flooding him)  
“Yes! This is ascension—the Aether Unleashed! No more chains!”  

*His form bulks up, shadows hardening like unbreakable armor—foreshadowing Kael's transformation.*

**CUT TO:**

**EXT. AETHERIA - DESCENT BEGINS (10:00–14:00)**  

*Lorcan’s greed tears Aetheria from its anchor. The city lurches, spires crumbling as it begins a slow, catastrophic descent—Heavenfall. Cassian watches in horror, the floating sanctuary now plummeting toward the world below. Alarms blare; gods and guardians scramble.*

![Heavenfall Descent](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/bcc5a776-d575-4d8d-976d-5490d90028cf)

**(SOUND: Groaning metal, falling debris. City-wide panic screams. Ominous descent rumble.)**

**CASSIAN** (desperate, flying toward the core)  
“Lorcan, what have you done?! The city—it's falling! Not into void, but onto the world below!”  

**LORCAN** (laughing maniacally, vanishing into the surge)  
“Let it fall! From the ruins, true power rises. You'll thank me when you're forced to fight without your precious laws!”  

*Cassian abandons pursuit, racing to Archonia at the core. The chamber is chaos—core overheating, threatening explosion.*

**ARCHONIA** (shouting over alarms)  
“We must bleed the pressure! The fall accelerates—impact will shatter both realms!”  

**CUT TO:**

**INT. AETHERIA CORE - CLIMAX (14:00–20:00)**  

*The only salvation: the Wellspring—an ancient energy sink, dormant for millennia. Activating it means draining the overload, but the surge is lethal. Archonia moves to the rusty controls, hand glowing.*

![Wellspring Controls](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/0dd735a5-8615-434a-b5eb-8f75766b24b8)

**(SOUND: Core whining to critical pitch. Tension strings build.)**

**ARCHONIA** (resolute)  
“Stand clear, Cassian. I initiate the Wellspring Activation. It's the only way.”  

**CASSIAN** (strained, stepping forward)  
“No. It takes all you have. Let me—my light can channel it!”  

*He plunges hands into the unstable core, merging life-force with the chaos. Golden aura flares, forcing energy down into the Wellspring. Blinding white flash erupts, followed by a deep blue sigh as the Wellspring awakens, consuming the Aether.*

![Cassian's Sacrifice](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/8ab37dda-ad5b-4765-84c2-7894775d560c)

**(SOUND: Explosive flash, then calming sigh. Cassian's pained gasp.)**

**CASSIAN** (eyes glowing fire blue, breathless)  
“The pressure... it's bleeding out. Hold... just hold...”  

*The shuddering ceases. Aetheria halts, hovering just above the world—a ruin saved at ultimate cost. Cassian collapses, aura dimming.*

![Wellspring Surge](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/32dcf4c6-91f6-46bb-a723-0817a50e535f)

**ARCHONIA** (kneeling beside him, voice breaking)  
“You've saved us... but at what price? Lorcan's free now, carrying the seed of Oblivion.”  

**CUT TO:**

**EXT. AETHERIA RUINS - RESOLUTION (20:00–22:00)**  

*Cassian, weakened, stares at the stabilized city. Lorcan vanished in the surge, now a volatile god unbound. The dark shift begins—leading to the Mythquake in Episode 1.*

![Aftermath](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/0a60d056-fa74-4701-85a8-0bbd40a60711)

**(SOUND: Fading alarms, ethereal hum. Narrator overlay.)**

**NARRATOR (V.O.)** (solemn)  
“Heavenfall averted, but the fracture widens. The gods' rivalry spills to the world below—where mortals will rise... or shatter.”  

**FADE OUT.**

**POST-CREDIT TEASER (22:00–22:40)**  

*A faint tremor echoes below. Cut to Earth: subtle hexagonal cracks in the sky. Whisper: “The Awakening begins...”*

**FADE TO BLACK.**

**FADE IN:**

**EXT. COSMIC VOID - DAY (00:00–01:20)**  

*The vast emptiness of space. Earth hangs fragile in the foreground. Suddenly, two colossal entities materialize: AETHER SOVEREIGN (luminous gold/white, crystalline form, precise and heroic like Goku's resolve) and OBLIVION ARCHON (chaotic violet/black, spiky entropy, explosive like Vegeta's pride). Their fists clash in a reality-warping impact—shockwaves ripple through spacetime, fracturing the sky into hexagonal patterns visible from Earth. Light flashes globally, mortals staring up in terror.*

![Mythquake Clash]![1000017716](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/4c942d33-99c2-4ae6-9bee-75d4e4ca3c96)

**(SOUND: CRACKING reality, DEAFENING THUD, COSMIC ROAR → silence. Sky fractures into HEXAGONS. Aether's resonant chime vs. Oblivion's crackling growl.)**

**NARRATOR (V.O.)**  
(solemn, echoing)  
“For eons they were bound. Today, the seal shattered—igniting a rivalry that will consume worlds.”  

**AETHER SOVEREIGN**  
(serene, ancient, like Goku's calm)  
“Creation demands balance.”  

**OBLIVION ARCHON**  
(cold sneer, like Vegeta's arrogance)  
“Then let balance die.”  

*The shockwave hits Earth: atmosphere distorts, lights flash. Cut to global panic—people in cities, fields, everywhere looking up.*

**(SOUND: Reverberation builds → distant human panic. Earth's groaning sub-bass.)**

**CIVILIAN 1** (panicked, overlapping)  
“What… what IS that?!”  

**CIVILIAN 2** (terrified)  
“The sky! It’s splitting—end of days!”  

**CIVILIAN 3** (tripping in panic)  
“Run! EVERYONE RUN!!!!!”  

**(SOUND: Chaos crescendo → final cosmic reverberation fades into a single, intimate HUMAN HEARTBEAT.)**

**TITLE CARD: MYTHOS X: GODSHIFT - EPISODE 1: HEAVENFALL**

**CUT TO:**

**EXT./INT. EARTH - VARIOUS LOCATIONS - CONTINUOUS (01:20–03:00)**  

*The aftershock ripples: cars hover, streetlights flicker violet, leaves freeze mid-air. Hexagonal patterns web the sky. In bustling streets, labs, factories—panic ensues. Time stretches, reality bends.*

![Aftershock Panic](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a0fcb594-5f61-4000-89ac-53c029f79cf0)

**(SOUND: Cosmic hum → low unsettling drone. Wind-chime vibrations. Distant shouts.)**

**CIVILIAN 4** (frantic woman, staring at hovering car)  
“My car! It’s… floating? What’s happening?!”  

**CIVILIAN 5** (incredulous man, pointing skyward)  
“Look! It’s still there! Like a giant spiderweb in the sky—this isn’t good, man!”  

**CIVILIAN 6** (child, 4-5, innocent awe)  
“Look Mommy, pretty colors…”  

*A distant TV blares amid the chaos.*

**NEWS ANCHOR (V.O.)** (static-laced, urgent)  
“This is not the first anomaly. Reports match the 1977 ‘Silent Flash’ over Tokyo… could this be the rivalry's return?”  

**NARRATOR (V.O.)** (urgent, like a sports announcer)  
“When gods clash, mortals tremble. But some… hear the call—and rise to rival it.”  

![Global Anomaly](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/614b6dc8-7434-4d0f-b43d-2717a2864d84)

**(SOUND: Drone fades → subtle pulse grows. Transition to distinct character sounds.)**

**CUT TO:**

**INT./EXT. EARTH - SIMULTANEOUS CLOSE-UPS (03:00–06:00)**  

*Three parallel awakenings, intercut for tension.*

**JAX REYES (mid-20s, kind-hearted boxer, Goku-like spirit) in a gritty gym, mid-punch on a sparring partner. Shockwave hits—gold sparks crawl up his arms, coiling muscles. He drops his partner with an accidental burst. Wide-eyed grin of excitement amid shock.*

![Jax Awakening](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ab238405-ed16-44ea-9a42-9df3470f1d38)

**JAX**  
(grunts in shock, then excited laugh)  
“Whoa! This power… it’s like nothing I’ve felt! Gotta get stronger!”  

*(Other boxers freeze, oblivious to his transformation.)*

**DR. MICHAEL BANNER (30s, glasses askew, analytical genius) in cluttered lab, over flickering monitors. Energy pulses—blue glyphs shimmer around his head, decoding chaotic data. He types frantically, overwhelmed yet fascinated.*

![Banner Awakening](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a2d657f8-7f3c-4a66-a52e-41026c174974)

**BANNER**  
(clutching head)  
“Rerouting quantum lattice—come on, isolate the frequency!”  

*(Monitor flashes: MYTHFLOW RESONANCE: 99.7%)*  

**BANNER** (continued)  
“That’s not possible… unless the old rivalries are real.”  

**KAEL DRAYVEN (mid-20s, grease-covered mechanic, Vegeta-Luke Cage fusion: prideful, unbreakable grit) under a junkyard vehicle. Violet energy ripples—faint scar on wrist glows, shadow detaches with ominous flame. Eyes glow purple; he feels emptiness, collapses with spiraling sigils.*

![Kael Awakening](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/1eb3c1c0-29a8-476c-afaa-e7981ceed3b8)

**KAEL**  
(gruff whisper, pride cracking, clenching fist)  
“Not again… this time, I’ll crush everything in my way.”  

*(Unbreakable aura flickers like Luke Cage's skin; he passes out unnoticed.)*

**(SOUND: For Jax: Golden hum building. Banner: Digital beeps escalating. Kael: Menacing violet pulse. Intercut builds tension.)**

**CUT TO:**

**EXT. DESOLATE URBAN STREET - LATER (06:00–10:00)**  

*Fractured, smoking from Mythquake. Kael stands amid destruction, violet aura tearing asphalt, consuming debris into nothingness. Rigid posture, glowing eyes, cold mask. Oblivion Archon's shadow looms behind. Jax skids in, gold aura flickering novice-like. Eyes lock—ground shatters between them. Faint golden sky light opposes violet.*

**(SOUND: Kael’s growling power, cracking earth. Jax’s hesitant hum. Distant screams. Aether’s faint chime vs. Oblivion’s pulse.)**

**JAX** (shocked, Goku-like friendly grin)  
“Yo Kael, right? What in… what are you doing?! Did you do all of this damage, bro? That ain't right, I mean, people are still out here. You know you’re glowing right? Look at you! We were supposed to spar someday—you’re the unbreakable street king I’ve heard about!”  

**KAEL/OBLIVION** (cold sneer, Vegeta arrogance fused with Cage's grit)  
“The strong clear the path. Get out of my way, pretty boy. Your glow is irritating me. You’re not worthy of my power.”  

**JAX** (growing anger, disbelieving wonder)  
“You can’t just… delete everything! What’s your problem? Why are you doing this?! What glow— oooooo yeahh… wow, I am! THIS IS CRAZY, bro! Hey, Kael, why am I glowing like you?! Is it because of… Wait—WE’RE BOTH GLOWING! This is like that ultimate training I’ve dreamed of! Come on, rival—let’s figure this out together!”  

**KAEL/OBLIVION** (Kael’s cynicism amplified, irritation rising)  
“—I’m not your brother! Move, or we’re going to have a problem, soft Jax. You always have been. You’re nothing but a naive fool—I’ll crush you like the rest!”  

**JAX** (joyful realization, ignoring threat)  
“So you do know me, huh?! HA! I KNEW IT! You’re that street fighter, right? I heard you were the best. I’ve always wanted to fight you – not like, fight-fight, but you know… spar. So you think we’re glowing for the same reason? Is it like… a new kind of training?”  

**KAEL/OBLIVION** (exploding rage, Archon fully pronounced)  
“PLEASE SHUT UP AND LEAVE ME ALONE!!!!!!!!!!!!!”  

*(Massive violet AXE KICK unleashes—whoosh, storm swells. Kael's unbreakable aura shatters concrete like Luke Cage rampaging.)*

**KAEL/OBLIVION** (continued)  
“Or you’ll pay the ultimate price.”  

**JAX** (startled gasp, then exhilarated laugh)  
(GASP!) “WHOA! That was…! (Laugh) That was FAST! I didn’t even see it! (Determined edge) But… I saw enough.”  

*(Sharp golden crackle—Jax blocks/dodges. Storm swells further. Fighting music explodes.)*

**CUT TO:**

**EXT. DEVASTATED STREET - CONTINUOUS (10:00–17:00)**  

*Battle rages. Jax on one knee, panting, singed. Kael in full OBLIVION AVATAR: enormous armored form, violet energy roaring. Jax's aura sputters; Kael's dominates.*

**(SOUND: Fighting music to ominous drone. Kael’s roar. Jax pants heavily. Aether’s faint chime.)**

**JAX** (exhausted, still chatty)  
(Panting) "Whoa... okay, dude. You got armor now. That is so unfair. Is that... is that custom? Because it looks kinda bulky, bro. But Kael, we’re rivals, not enemies! My little sister’s school is two blocks from here—you can’t just destroy everything!”  

**KAEL/OBLIVION** (deep, cold, patience gone)  
"This is not a game, Jax. This is the end. You chose the path of weakness—I choose dominance.”  

*(Heavy violet pressure blast—Jax groans.)*

**JAX** (painful laugh)  
"Ow. Yeah, no, I get it, I get it! But like, the glow. Mine's still gold, right? And yours is like, black and purple. So who gets the better color scheme, you think? I'm betting on gold. But I won’t let you go full villain on me, bro!”  

**KAEL/OBLIVION** (fury peaking)  
"Your endless prattling will be the first thing I extinguish. Oblivion is silence."  

*(Kael charges max—air disintegrates. Oblivion specter swells.)*

**JAX** (desperate, eyes closed)  
"I... I don't want to hurt anyone... but I can't let you hurt them, Kael."  

**(SOUND: Ethereal whisper in Jax’s mind.)**

**AETHER SOVEREIGN (V.O.)** (soft, commanding)  
"Creation is not mercy... it's choice."  

**JAX** (sharp inhale, realization)  
"Choice."  

*(Immense golden chime erupts—Jax's aura roars back. Debris reverses, fires extinguish.)*

**KAEL/OBLIVION** (shock, rage)  
"IMPOSSIBLE! You are nothing!"  

**JAX** (rising, confident surge)  
"Wrong. I’m choosing to stand up—for you, for everyone. Let’s see if your pride can handle a real fight!”  

*(Powerful golden concussion blast pushes Kael back miles. Epic theme swells—final confrontation begins.)*

**CUT TO:**

**EXT. HIGH ATMOSPHERE - CLIMAX (17:00–22:00)**  

*Avatars ascend: Jax (unstable gold sigils, base form) vs. Kael (full Avatar). Blurring trails—Kael's wide void sweeps, Jax's precise martial blasts. Archons loom behind: Oblivion pushing destruction, Aether channeling defense.*

**KAEL/OBLIVION** (arrogant roar)  
"You cling to a dying world, Jax. Let it go. This is its cleansing—I am unbreakable!”  

**JAX** (strained, resolve)  
"No way! This isn't 'cleansing,' Kael! I won’t let my rival destroy what we could protect together!”  

*(Violent clashes. City groans below.)*

**KAEL/OBLIVION** (sneer, furious)  
"Still playing the hero, boxer? The world doesn't need saviors. It needs to be remade. And I am the architect of its undoing."  

*(Kael tears open massive BLACK RIFT—void rumble, fabric ripping.)*

**KAEL/OBLIVION** (continued)  
"Futility! Behold the Null Vector Collapse!"  

**JAX** (alarm, steeling self)  
"A rift?! Whoa, that's a big move! Okay, okay, uh... gotta close that up!"  

*(Jax channels Aether Burst—harmonious chime pushes back.)*

*(Energies compress—deafening silence.)*
