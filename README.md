# Mythos X: Godshift  
## Pilot Episode 0 — **Before Heavenfall**  
### Full Episode Script — 22-Minute Runtime  
*By Christopher Perry — 2025*  
*This is the  prequel pilot episode script, setting the stage for Episode 1: Heavenfall. This 22-minute anime episode with cosmic rivalries, high-stakes drama, and visual spectacle. Cassian embodies a heroic, light-speed guardian (foreshadowing Jax's pure-hearted strength), while Lorcan fuses dark ambition and unbreakable force (precursor to Kael's Vegeta-Luke Cage villainy). The storyline builds tension through godly drills, rebellion, and catastrophe, leading directly into the Mythquake of Episode 1. Images integrated for visual storytelling—optimized for GitHub to make this repo a shining anime showcase.*

*“Before the fall, there was the fracture.”*

**FADE IN:**

**EXT. AETHERIA - CITY OF THE GODS - ETERNAL DAY (00:00–03:00)**  

*The majestic floating city of Aetheria gleams in eternal light, spires of crystalline gold piercing endless clouds. Power hums like currency in the air. CASSIAN (golden-armored, agile warrior with light-speed grace, heroic like a proto-Jax) dashes through the sky, fists blazing with pure luminous energy. LORCAN (shadow-clad, massive build with unshakable force, dark and prideful like a proto-Kael) stands firm, his form rippling with violet entropy. This is a Mythquake drill—a ritual clash of rivals. But tension crackles like a live wire; Lorcan's eyes burn with contempt for the rules binding their power.*

![Mythquake Drill](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b6c4341c-c6a4-4d4f-b418-29ece43f9bea)

**(SOUND: Whistling wind from Cassian's speed, deep rumbles from Lorcan's impacts. Cosmic thunder echoes with each clash. Epic orchestral build.)**

**LORCAN** (low rumble, sneering contempt)  
“Still clinging to the laws, Cassian? Those chains keep our true potential caged—like weaklings afraid of their own strength.”  

**CASSIAN** (calm resolve, mid-dash, voice steady like a guardian's oath)  
“The laws protect the balance, Lorcan. Without them, we'd destroy everything we guard. Focus—show me your force!”  

*Cassian strikes with a blinding light punch. Lorcan braces, absorbing the hit. Shockwave tears through the sky, fracturing clouds into faint hexagonal patterns—foreshadowing the greater quake to come. Lorcan remains unbeaten, but his satisfaction fades; he craves the Archons' limitless power.*

**LORCAN** (gritting, pushing back with a shadow-infused counter)  
“Balance? That's your excuse for holding back. I want the power to crush any threat—not play these games!”  

*The ground quivers—not from their fists, but a deep, ancient thrumming from below. Lorcan glares at the flawless city, his gaze on the tremor.*

**(SOUND: Subtle seismic rumble builds, overlaying the fight's impacts. Transition to ominous hum.)**

**CUT TO:**

**INT. AETHERIA'S CORE CHAMBER - CONTINUOUS (03:00–06:00)**  

*ARCHONIA (ancient, regal Archon of Aetheria, wise and commanding) stands in the glowing heart of the city, surrounded by holographic energy maps. She feels the tremor in her bones— this is no drill; it's a rupture in reality. Far below, in the suppressed world, ancient powers stir: The Awakening Below. Her hand raises, sending a silent alarm to the highest echelons. The chamber shakes slightly, lights flickering violet-gold.*

![Archonia's Alarm](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b0560c95-4368-489c-bdfd-8be051e05554)

**(SOUND: Alarms blare subtly, core thrumming intensifies. Ethereal chimes signal the alert.)**

**ARCHONIA** (urgent, voice echoing with authority)  
“This tremor... it's not ours. The seals are weakening. The world below awakens—demanding what we've long suppressed.”  

*Cut back to the drill: Archonia's voice booms over comms, calling it off.*

**ARCHONIA (V.O.)** (firm)  
“Cease the Mythquake drill! Unstable core detected. Return to stations—all warriors!”  

*Lorcan smirks, seeing opportunity in the chaos. Cassian pauses, concerned.*

**LORCAN** (sneering, under breath)  
“Unstable? Or vulnerable? You hold back the power that could stop any threat, yet you fear the ground shaking.”  

**CUT TO:**

**EXT. AETHERIA SKYLINE - IMMEDIATELY AFTER (06:00–10:00)**  

*Lorcan declares his rebellion, shattering the peace. He turns from Cassian, facing the churning darkness below the city. His aura flares violet, shadows coiling like unbreakable chains. Cassian reaches out, but Lorcan shrugs him off with prideful disdain.*

![Lorcan's Declaration](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/5da769c1-f2cf-4731-98a5-efde73de577d)

**(SOUND: Dramatic swell—Lorcan's growl builds to a roar. City alarms wail in the background.)**

**LORCAN** (defiant, voice booming)  
“The only law I follow is the law of strength! If the Archons won't unleash our true power, I'll take it myself. This 'balance' ends now—Kael’s Rebellion begins!”  

**CASSIAN** (shocked, trying to reason)  
“Lorcan, wait! This tremor—it's a sign. Rebelling now could doom us all!”  

*Lorcan ignores him, plunging toward the city's energy main—a glowing conduit of raw cosmic power. With a guttural shout, he rips the seals from his own power core, hand diving into the main. He consumes it, body reshaping in a terrifying surge.*

![Power Consumption](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/7f43ae13-859f-4a09-8f09-69746243b929)

**(SOUND: Violent energy whoosh, crackling overload. Lorcan's agonized roar turns triumphant.)**

**LORCAN** (ecstatic, power flooding him)  
“Yes! This is ascension—the Aether Unleashed! No more chains!”  

*His form bulks up, shadows hardening like unbreakable armor—foreshadowing Kael's transformation.*

**CUT TO:**

**EXT. AETHERIA - DESCENT BEGINS (10:00–14:00)**  

*Lorcan’s greed tears Aetheria from its anchor. The city lurches, spires crumbling as it begins a slow, catastrophic descent—Heavenfall. Cassian watches in horror, the floating sanctuary now plummeting toward the world below. Alarms blare; gods and guardians scramble.*

![Heavenfall Descent](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/bcc5a776-d575-4d8d-976d-5490d90028cf)

**(SOUND: Groaning metal, falling debris. City-wide panic screams. Ominous descent rumble.)**

**CASSIAN** (desperate, flying toward the core)  
“Lorcan, what have you done?! The city—it's falling! Not into void, but onto the world below!”  

**LORCAN** (laughing maniacally, vanishing into the surge)  
“Let it fall! From the ruins, true power rises. You'll thank me when you're forced to fight without your precious laws!”  

*Cassian abandons pursuit, racing to Archonia at the core. The chamber is chaos—core overheating, threatening explosion.*

**ARCHONIA** (shouting over alarms)  
“We must bleed the pressure! The fall accelerates—impact will shatter both realms!”  

**CUT TO:**

**INT. AETHERIA CORE - CLIMAX (14:00–20:00)**  

*The only salvation: the Wellspring—an ancient energy sink, dormant for millennia. Activating it means draining the overload, but the surge is lethal. Archonia moves to the rusty controls, hand glowing.*

![Wellspring Controls](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/0dd735a5-8615-434a-b5eb-8f75766b24b8)

**(SOUND: Core whining to critical pitch. Tension strings build.)**

**ARCHONIA** (resolute)  
“Stand clear, Cassian. I initiate the Wellspring Activation. It's the only way.”  

**CASSIAN** (strained, stepping forward)  
“No. It takes all you have. Let me—my light can channel it!”  

*He plunges hands into the unstable core, merging life-force with the chaos. Golden aura flares, forcing energy down into the Wellspring. Blinding white flash erupts, followed by a deep blue sigh as the Wellspring awakens, consuming the Aether.*

![Cassian's Sacrifice](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/8ab37dda-ad5b-4765-84c2-7894775d560c)


**(SOUND: Explosive flash, then calming sigh. Cassian's pained gasp.)**

**CASSIAN** (eyes glowing fire blue, breathless)  
“The pressure... it's bleeding out. Hold... just hold...”  

*The shuddering ceases. Aetheria halts, hovering just above the world—a ruin saved at ultimate cost. Cassian collapses, aura dimming.*

![Wellspring Surge](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/32dcf4c6-91f6-46bb-a723-0817a50e535f)

**ARCHONIA** (kneeling beside him, voice breaking)  
“You've saved us... but at what price? Lorcan's free now, carrying the seed of Oblivion this power can not be controled it will consume him and use a Cassian.”  

**CUT TO:**

**EXT. AETHERIA RUINS - RESOLUTION (20:00–22:00)**  

*Cassian, weakened, stares at the stabilized city. Lorcan vanished in the surge, now a volatile god unbound. The dark shift begins—leading to the Mythquake in Episode 1.*

**NARRATOR (V.O.)** (solemn)  
“Heavenfall averted, but the fracture widens. The gods' rivalry spills to the world below—where mortals will rise... or shatter.”  ![1000017752](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/90ff4853-a1e7-49ca-b518-5ff18b60d473)

# Mythos X: Godshift  
## Episode 0 Part2 Pilot — **The Return of Oblivion**  
### Full Episode Script — 22-Minute Runtime  
*By Christopher Perry — 2025*  
*This episode bridges Episode 0: Before Heavenfall directly into the events of Heavenfall (the original Episode 1). It focuses on Lorcan—now fully embodying Oblivion—returning with vengeful might to cause the final fall of the heavens. His actions ignite a massive multi-universal battle, forcing Cassian (transformed into the Aether Sovereign through his sacrifice) into a fraternal, eternal struggle against his old friend and rival. The cosmic clash ripples across universes, fracturing seals and awakening mortal avatars below, setting the stage for the mythquake in Heavenfall. Script paced for 22 minutes with high-drama action, emotional betrayal, and visual spectacle—optimized for GitHub as a shining anime showcase. (No new images provided; placeholders used based on thematic fit from previous assets.)*

*“From ruins rises the void—old bonds shatter in eternal war.”*

---

**FADE IN:**

**EXT. RUINS OF AETHERIA - ETERNAL TWILIGHT (00:00–03:00)**  

*The shattered remnants of Aetheria hover precariously above the mortal world, a ghostly silhouette against fractured skies. Faint hexagonal cracks linger in the ether, remnants of the near-Heavenfall. CASSIAN (now AETHER SOVEREIGN: luminous gold-white form, crystalline and empowered, but scarred from his sacrifice—eyes glowing fire-blue) patrols the ruins, his light-speed grace tempered by weary resolve. He senses a dark pulse growing—Lorcan's return.*


**(SOUND: Eerie wind howls through debris. Subtle violet pulses build. Orchestral tension swells.)**

**AETHER SOVEREIGN (CASSIAN)** (voice resonant, ancient yet pained)  
“damint Larconnnn are fighting should have caused this much pain. now the seal won't  hold you foul! why  Lorcan, your my oldest friend—if you're out there, turn back. Our rivalry doesn't have to end worlds.”  

*A violet rift tears open in the void. LORCAN (now OBLIVION: massive, spiky violet-black entropy form, unbreakable shadow armor fused with raw chaos—pride amplified to villainous dominance) emerges, aura consuming light. He laughs, a guttural echo shaking the ruins.*

<img width="896" height="1280" alt="1000017769" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/5da3f901-f4c5-4319-8ebc-6a1b962b55be" />

![1000017758](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/4449c965-0e35-46e4-9ab9-ae48c1f63101)


**OBLIVION (LORCAN)** (cold sneer, booming with arrogance)  
“Turn back? I've ascended beyond your 'balance,' Cassian. The heavens are mine to crush—starting with this pathetic remnant!”  

*The ground quivers anew—Lorcan's might ignites the fall once more.*

**CUT TO:**

**EXT. MULTI-UNIVERSAL VOID - INTERCUT (03:00–06:00)**  

*Ripples spread: parallel universes flicker into view—alternate realms where gods clash eternally. Lorcan's return fractures barriers, pulling them into a massive battle. Aether Sovereign dashes at light-speed, fists meeting Lorcan's unshakable force in a reality-warping skirmish.*

**(SOUND: Cosmic thunder, dimensional rips. Aether's chime vs. Oblivion's growl intensifies.)**

**AETHER SOVEREIGN** (mid-clash, pleading fraternal tone)  
“We were brothers in arms, Lorcan! This power—you've let it consume you. Stop before you drag every universe into oblivion!”  

**Larcon-OBLIVION energy** (prideful rage, countering with void sweeps)  
“Brothers? ha never you looked down on me for our entire lives 


**Story** Lorcan, no longer just a shadow but Oblivion reborn, rejected the very name he was given. His true self was a void of limitless power, and Cassian's golden reflection of his pure heart was an insult to it. 


**Larcon-OBLIVION energy** "This is no drill, brother," Lorcan snarled, his voice vibrating with cosmic hunger.
"This is the final annulment of all Order i have heared his Voice. He calls for OBLIVION and distruction of order! This ends the Archons' reign now!"

*Shockwaves breach universes: glimpses of collapsing stars, awakening entities. The fraternal struggle eternalizes—old friends locked in cosmic war.*

**CUT TO:**

**INT. AETHERIA'S SHATTERED CORE - CONTINUOUS (06:00–10:00)**  

*ARCHONIA (weakened, rallying survivors) monitors the core, alarms blaring as Lorcan's energy surges. The Wellspring pulses erratically, echoing Cassian's sacrifice. Lorcan bursts in, consuming residual power, his form growing more monstrous.*

**(SOUND: Overload crackles, alarms wail. Lorcan's menacing pulse dominates.)**

**ARCHONIA** (defiant, to Lorcan)  
“Your rebellion failed once please dont let your pride be the death of us all. The Sovereign will stop you again—the seals won't break he will kill use all then you dont you get that!”  

**OBLIVION** (sneering, hand plunging into the core)  
“Failed? It awakened me! Now, I consume it all—igniting the battle across universes!”  You think you have the answers don't, His voice got more demonic as he held"

*Aether Sovereign arrives, blocking with a luminous barrier. Their clash escalates, fracturing the core further—multi-universal echoes amplify the fight.*

**AETHER SOVEREIGN** (straining, emotional)  
“Lorcan, this isn't strength—it's madness! Remember our trainings ? We pushed each other to protect, not destroy!”  

**OBLIVION** (exploding with dominance)  
“Protection? Weakness! Feel my might—the heavens fall now!”  The universe is fraud and needs to be destroyed and returned tk darkness once all is destroyed and there will be peace 

**CUT TO:**

**EXT. CROSS-UNIVERSAL BATTLEFIELD - CLIMAX BUILD (10:00–14:00)**  

*The struggle spills into merged realms: shattered heavens from multiple universes collide. Lorcan's void attacks tear portals, summoning chaotic entities. Aether Sovereign counters with precise light blasts, but the fraternal bond weighs heavy—each blow a betrayal.*
![1000017770](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/50f7cafd-f8f8-4429-840e-fcaf959fbea9)

**(SOUND: Dimensional explosions, roars from void beasts. Epic theme surges.)**


**Story**
The clash was no mere explosion; it was a wound in Aetheria's heart. Oblivion's power met the Aether Sovereign's light, and the city itself screamed in response. A shockwave tore across the firmament, not of air, but of fractured reality—the true, catastrophic Mythquake, an immediate, violent promise of the chaos Lorcan intended to deliver 

**OBLIVION** (triumphant, unleashing a massive void wave)  
“See? Universes bow to me! Your 'eternal struggle' ends in my shadow Brother!”  

**AETHER SOVEREIGN** (dodging, resolve hardening)  
“Not while I stand, old friend. For every world you threaten, is a world to.manh my bond demands you to stop your not thinking straight!”  

*The battle ignites fully: allied gods from other universes join briefly, but Lorcan's unbreakable might overwhelms, pushing heavens toward final collapse.*

<img width="896" height="1280" alt="1000017771" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/84974d0e-52d9-47c0-a574-e43d06f700b9" />

**Story**

Swash Bang Bang Bang BANGGGGGG!!! A brittle silence followed the rupture. Cassian, battered but resolute, moved with the speed of pure light. Lorcan, the heavy shadow, met him again. 

**Larcon-Oblivion energy- "Still clinging to the laws, Cassian?"         Lorcan's voice was a low rumble, filled with contempt for the rules that kept their true potential caged. The Archons had always feared the unlimited. THIS WILL BE YOUR END

**CUT TO:**

**EXT. HEAVEN'S EDGE - INTENSIFYING STRUGGLE (14:00–18:00)**  

*Aether Sovereign channels his fire-blue eyes' power—remnant of the Wellspring—creating a crystalline shield. Lorcan hammers it with entropy fists, cracks spreading like veins across realities. Below, on Earth, faint awakenings stir (foreshadowing Jax, Kael, Banner).*

![1000017773](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/da6f1ed2-7fa3-44aa-998a-81fcd668f13e)


**(SOUND: Crystalline chimes shatter under growls. Universal groans echo.)**

**AETHER SOVEREIGN** (pained, fraternal plea)  
“We were rivals, not enemies! This fall—it's not victory; it's the end of everything we fought for what are you doing Larcon!”  

**OBLIVION** (arrogant laugh, breaking through)  
“Rivals? Larcon laughs with a massive right duck hot his face ugh.  I surpassed you! Feel the might that ignites the multi-universal war—your heavens will crumble under my fist! 

*The shield shatters; Lorcan's blow sends shockwaves downward, initiating the mythquake.*

**CUT TO:**

**EXT. FALLING HEAVENS - CLIMAX (18:00–21:00)**  

*Heavens plummet fully—Lorcan's might realized. Aether Sovereign rallies for one final stand, merging with residual Aether to counter.

**FADE IN:**

**EXT. COSMIC VOID - DAY (00:00–01:20)**  

*The vast emptiness of space. Earth hangs fragile in the foreground. Suddenly, two colossal entities materialize: AETHER SOVEREIGN (luminous gold/white, crystalline form, precise and heroic like Goku's resolve) and OBLIVION ARCHON (chaotic violet/black, spiky entropy, explosive like Vegeta's pride). Their fists clash in a reality-warping impact—shockwaves ripple through spacetime, fracturing the sky into hexagonal patterns visible from Earth. Light flashes globally, mortals staring up in terror.*

*(Unbreakable aura flickers like Luke Cage's skin; he passes out unnoticed.)*

**(SOUND: For Jax: Golden hum building. Banner: Digital beeps escalating. Kael: Menacing violet pulse. Intercut builds tension.)**

**CUT TO:**

**EXT. DESOLATE URBAN STREET - LATER (06:00–10:00)**  

*Fractured, smoking from Mythquake. Kael stands amid destruction, violet aura tearing asphalt, consuming debris into nothingness. Rigid posture, glowing eyes, cold mask. Oblivion Archon's shadow looms behind. Jax skids in, gold aura flickering novice-like. Eyes lock—ground shatters between them. Faint golden sky light opposes violet.*

**(SOUND: Kael’s growling power, cracking earth. Jax’s hesitant hum. Distant screams. Aether’s faint chime vs. Oblivion’s pulse.)**

**JAX** (shocked, Goku-like friendly grin)  
“Yo Kael, right? What in… what are you doing?! Did you do all of this damage, bro? That ain't right, I mean, people are still out here. You know you’re glowing right? Look at you! We were supposed to spar someday—you’re the unbreakable street king I’ve heard about!”  

**KAEL/OBLIVION** (cold sneer, Vegeta arrogance fused with Cage's grit)  
“The strong clear the path. Get out of my way, pretty boy. Your glow is irritating me. You’re not worthy of my power.”  

**JAX** (growing anger, disbelieving wonder)  
“You can’t just… delete everything! What’s your problem? Why are you doing this?! What glow— oooooo yeahh… wow, I am! THIS IS CRAZY, bro! Hey, Kael, why am I glowing like you?! Is it because of… Wait—WE’RE BOTH GLOWING! This is like that ultimate training I’ve dreamed of! Come on, rival—let’s figure this out together!”  

**KAEL/OBLIVION** (Kael’s cynicism amplified, irritation rising)  
“—I’m not your brother! Move, or we’re going to have a problem, soft Jax. You always have been. You’re nothing but a naive fool—I’ll crush you like the rest!”  

**JAX** (joyful realization, ignoring threat)  
“So you do know me, huh?! HA! I KNEW IT! You’re that street fighter, right? I heard you were the best. I’ve always wanted to fight you – not like, fight-fight, but you know… spar. So you think we’re glowing for the same reason? Is it like… a new kind of training?”  

**KAEL/OBLIVION** (exploding rage, Archon fully pronounced)  
“PLEASE SHUT UP AND LEAVE ME ALONE!!!!!!!!!!!!!”  

*(Massive violet AXE KICK unleashes—whoosh, storm swells. Kael's unbreakable aura shatters concrete like Luke Cage rampaging.)*

**KAEL/OBLIVION** (continued)  
“Or you’ll pay the ultimate price.”  

**JAX** (startled gasp, then exhilarated laugh)  
(GASP!) “WHOA! That was…! (Laugh) That was FAST! I didn’t even see it! (Determined edge) But… I saw enough.”  

*(Sharp golden crackle—Jax blocks/dodges. Storm swells further. Fighting music explodes.)*

**CUT TO:**

**EXT. DEVASTATED STREET - CONTINUOUS (10:00–17:00)**  

*Battle rages. Jax on one knee, panting, singed. Kael in full OBLIVION AVATAR: enormous armored form, violet energy roaring. Jax's aura sputters; Kael's dominates.*

**(SOUND: Fighting music to ominous drone. Kael’s roar. Jax pants heavily. Aether’s faint chime.)**

**JAX** (exhausted, still chatty)  
(Panting) "Whoa... okay, dude. You got armor now. That is so unfair. Is that... is that custom? Because it looks kinda bulky, bro. But Kael, we’re rivals, not enemies! My little sister’s school is two blocks from here—you can’t just destroy everything!”  

**KAEL/OBLIVION** (deep, cold, patience gone)  
"This is not a game, Jax. This is the end. You chose the path of weakness—I choose dominance.”  

*(Heavy violet pressure blast—Jax groans.)*

**JAX** (painful laugh)  
"Ow. Yeah, no, I get it, I get it! But like, the glow. Mine's still gold, right? And yours is like, black and purple. So who gets the better color scheme, you think? I'm betting on gold. But I won’t let you go full villain on me, bro!”  

**KAEL/OBLIVION** (fury peaking)  
"Your endless prattling will be the first thing I extinguish. Oblivion is silence."  

*(Kael charges max—air disintegrates. Oblivion specter swells.)*

**JAX** (desperate, eyes closed)  
"I... I don't want to hurt anyone... but I can't let you hurt them, Kael."  

**(SOUND: Ethereal whisper in Jax’s mind.)**

**AETHER SOVEREIGN (V.O.)** (soft, commanding)  
"Creation is not mercy... it's choice."  

**JAX** (sharp inhale, realization)  
"Choice."  

*(Immense golden chime erupts—Jax's aura roars back. Debris reverses, fires extinguish.)*

**KAEL/OBLIVION** (shock, rage)  
"IMPOSSIBLE! You are nothing!"  

**JAX** (rising, confident surge)  
"Wrong. I’m choosing to stand up—for you, for everyone. Let’s see if your pride can handle a real fight!”  

*(Powerful golden concussion blast pushes Kael back miles. Epic theme swells—final confrontation begins.)*

**CUT TO:**

**EXT. HIGH ATMOSPHERE - CLIMAX (17:00–22:00)**  

*Avatars ascend: Jax (unstable gold sigils, base form) vs. Kael (full Avatar). Blurring trails—Kael's wide void sweeps, Jax's precise martial blasts. Archons loom behind: Oblivion pushing destruction, Aether channeling defense.*

![Rift Formation](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/421ff829-9571-45a2-a023-abe81c17e482)

**(SOUND: Orchestral intensity. Power roars. Storm rages.)**

**KAEL/OBLIVION** (arrogant roar)  
"You cling to a dying world, Jax. Let it go. This is its cleansing—I am unbreakable!”  

**JAX** (strained, resolve)  
"No way! This isn't 'cleansing,' Kael! I won’t let my rival destroy what we could protect together!”  

*(Violent clashes. City groans below.)*

**KAEL/OBLIVION** (sneer, furious)  
"Still playing the hero, boxer? The world doesn't need saviors. It needs to be remade. And I am the architect of its undoing."  

*(Kael tears open massive BLACK RIFT—void rumble, fabric ripping.)*

**KAEL/OBLIVION** (continued)  
"Futility! Behold the Null Vector Collapse!"  

**JAX** (alarm, steeling self)  
"A rift?! Whoa, that's a big move! Okay, okay, uh... gotta close that up!"  

*(Jax channels Aether Burst—harmonious chime pushes back.)*

*(Energies compress—deafening silence.)*

**NARRATOR (V.O.)** (solemn)  
“When gods fall… humanity rises. And from their collision was born… the Genesis Seed.”  

*(Silence shatters—crackling explosion. White sphere expands, moon cracks visually. Sound distorts, fades to reverberation.)*

**FADE OUT.**

**POST-CREDIT SEQUENCE (22:00–22:40)**  

**INT. BANNER'S RUINED LAB - NIGHT**  

*Banner (battered, driven) over operational monitor: oscillating signatures from the sphere. A glowing mythflow fragment (gold-violet crystal) drifts into his hand. Awe fills his face.*

*(Cracked monitors flicker: WELLSPRING_PROTOCOL_01 — ACTIVE.)*

**BANNER** (whisper, profound)  
"This changes everything..."  

**FADE TO BLACK.**
